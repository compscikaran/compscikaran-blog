## My Problem with the Apple watch and its clones

For the past couple of months I have been noticing a worrying trend. I have been recently getting into watches and that means I have a tendency to notice what other people have on their wrist all the time. Everywhere I glance I find smart watches especially apple watches and their clones from cheaper brands. While I see the functional advantages of smart watches especially for folks who have medical conditions which require constant monitoring, for the majority of people they are really quite useless. Here are the some of the problems I see with the apple watch.

1. **Planned Obsolescence** - Watches tend to last beyond generations often passed around as heirlooms from one generation to another. They use designs that are classic and do not go out of style. They do not require you to upgrade the software or hardware to maintain their charm. Everyone who has an apple watch always feels like they should upgrade every few years to a better model.

2. **Smartbands can do 90% of what you need** - When it comes to tracking workouts you can get a cheap smart band like the ones from Xiaomi or Fitbit which serve the purpose of quite well. These also have very good sleep tracking functions if you are into that. There are many apps like Google fit that can track activities from your phone directly as well without the need for a dedicated device.

3. **Distractions** - Smart watches cause constant distractions when worn during the day. The constant stream of notifications, ability to check social media especially if available on your wrist makes it more convenient than pulling out your phone, unlocking it and opening an app. This reduction in barriers makes it easier to lose focus. 

4. **Style** - Lastly these smart watches look ridiculous especially when dressed up or worn with formals. Watches look good with anything and enhance your outfit rather than taking away from it.

## What you can do instead.

Watches are a unique breed of accessories that are timeless and classic. They are functional and often have additional complications beyond just showing the time such as day, date, chronograph, dive timer, tachymeter etc. Traditional watches are much more reliable whether it be a mechanical or quartz piece. They have less moving parts and are less prone to failure and often last decades. This longevity makes them very good heirlooms which can be passed on from one generation to another. Watches demonstrate an appreciation of craftsmanship and a good taste. So instead of going for an apple watch or its cheaper clones Here are options at various different price points to get you started in the world of watches. 

**Watch history 101**

For the unfamiliar with the innards of watches there are different types of mechanisms through which a watch works. These are called movements. Before the 1970s watches were mainly mechanical which means they operated using an intricate collection of springs and gears and had to be wound manually everyday using the crown we use to adjust the time. Automatic watches are a breed of mechanical watches that do not require hand winding and instead use the constant motion of your wrist to recharge during the day and springs to store the power at night. Automatics are considered to be more luxurious and hence are much more expensive. In 1970 Seiko launched the first quartz watch. Quartz watches use a battery powered oscillator circuit that relies on a quartz crystal to deliver extremely accurate timekeeping. For reference a mechanical watch loses few seconds a day whereas a quartz watch loses few seconds a month.

**A Rant on Fashion Watches and Drop-shipped brands**

Fashion watches are watches which are sold by companies that don’t actually make watches and are into other segments like clothing, handbags etc, some common examples being Armani Exchange, Hugo Boss and Fossil. Other companies such as MVMT and Daniel Wellington take cheap watches from China which you can find on Alibaba, slap their logo on it and market them on instagram. These watches are sold at a high markup and are not even worth a 10th of the cost. These watches may entice you with beautiful designs but do not fall for their trap as these are complete money making scams. Always go for trusted brands who have a demonstrated history in the watch industry such as the likes of Casio, Timex, Titan on the lower end and Alba, Seiko, Orient, Tissot on the higher end.


### Timepieces

**Casio Youth Diver**

A very less known piece in the Youth lineup by Casio this watch is very unique in its design. It combines the ruggedness of a G-shock with a resin based construction, circular indices and intricate watch hands from a dive watch and a day-date window from a formal watch. Perfect for both casual and semi formal occasions and extremely versatile.

**Casio Edifice Speedy** 

This line is inspired from motor racing and has lot of amazing designs but the one I find the best is the EFV-526L. Here also we see a striking resemblance with another Omega watch called the Speedmaster. There are some generic alternatives from the likes of Timex but in the quartz arena there isn’t any other line which can compete with the accuracy of the chronographs from Casio.

**Alba Submariner**

Alba is a subrand of legendary watchmaker Seiko, founded in 1970s. They serve as a more budget friendly entrypoint for folks coming from the quartz space and be a gateway to later on buying a more expensive Seiko. The designs are very solid taking inspiration from the submariner and GMT from Rolex. They use Seiko movements inside which will last you for decades.

**Seiko SRPE Dress KX**

This watch combines elements from many different genres of watches. The sunburst dial and day-date window are very beautifully integrated into the watch like a classic dress watch but the raised indices and hands are reminiscent of a dive watch. It is extremely versatile in its use case and can be worn with almost any outfit. 

Model Number - SRPE53K1

**Orient Maestro**


It has a very classic look with triangular indices, a simple date window and sharp hands. This makes it a good alternative to the Seiko Dress KX as it doesn’t use any elements from Diver watches and sticks to the vintage look. The Exhibition Caseback is also an added plus.
