## How I ended up writing this post and my take on the Apple watch

For the past couple of months I have been noticing a worrying trend. I have been recently getting into watches and that means I started noticing what other people are wearing all the time. Nowadays everywhere I glance I find smart watches especially apple watches and apple watch lookalikes. I was not a fan of the apple watch in general but I didn’t mind the galaxy watch style smart watches which look somewhat similar to a traditional watch. People I talk to more and more often seem to have this aspirational goal of getting an apple watch if they don’t already have one.

While I see the functional advantages of smart watches especially for folks who have medical conditions which require constant monitoring, for the majority of people they are really quite useless. When it comes to exercising you can get a cheap smart band like the ones from Xiaomi or Realme which serve the purpose quite well. These also have very good sleep tracking functions if you are into that. There are many apps like Google fit that can track activities from your phone directly as well. In the gym you can utilize the assistance of a trainer or just record what you did in your head.

Smart watches cause constant distractions when worn during the day. The constant stream of notifications, ability to check social media especially if available on your wrist makes it more convenient than pulling out your phone, unlocking it and opening an app. This reduction in barriers makes it easier to lose focus. Lastly these smart watches look ridiculous especially when dressed up or worn with formals. They look like immature / childish toys regardless of whatever rare earth material apple puts in their marketing.

## What you can do instead. Watches 101

Watches are a unique breed of accessories that are timeless and classic. They come with many advantages as well. They are functional and often have additional complications beyond just showing the time such as day, date, chronograph, tachymeter etc. Traditional watches are much more reliable whether it be a mechanical or quartz piece. They have less moving parts and are less prone to failure and often last decades. This longevity makes them very good heirlooms which can be passed on from one generation to another. Watches demonstrate an appreciation of craftsmanship and a good taste.

**How watches work**
For the unfamiliar with the innards of watches there are different types of mechanisms through which a watch works. These are called movements. Before the 1970s watches were mainly mechanical which means they operated using an intricate collection of springs and gears and had to be wound manually everyday using the crown we use to adjust the time. In 1970 Seiko launched the first quartz watch. This used a battery powered oscillator circuit that relies on a quartz crystal. Automatic watches are a breed of mechanical watches that do not require hand winding and instead use the constant motion of your wrist to recharge during the day and springs to store the power at night. Automatics are considered to be more luxurious and hence are much more expensive than quartz models in general.

**A Rant on Fashion Watches and Drop-shipped Crap**
Fashion watches are watches which are sold by companies that don’t actually make watches and are into other segments like clothes, bags etc. Some common examples are watches from Armani Exchange, Hugo Boss and Fossil. Other companies such as MVMT and Daniel Wellington take cheap watches from China which you can find on Alibaba and slap their logo on it and market the hell out of them. These watches are sold for 10-15k which are not even worth a 10th of the cost. These watches may entice you with beautiful designs but do not fall for their trap. These are complete garbage and money making scams. Always go for trusted brands with a demonstrated history in the watch industry.

## The Versatile 3 watch Collection

**Strategy** - To build a collection with good variety in terms of design and functionality I am going to use certain tricks. Since we are going for variety over luxury in this scenario I will build it using quartz pieces only. I am all in on quartz personally as these are an order of magnitude more accurate than any mechanical options. For instance a mechanical watches looses 5-15 seconds a day whereas a quartz watch looses 5-10 seconds a month !

### Brands
**Casio** is one of the oldest and most well respected watchmakers based out of Japan. The company was founded in 1950s mostly being involved into making calculators and mechanical parts but it started making watches in the 1970s. They focus mostly on quartz models which show exceptionally high quality control, The second hand accurately hits the markers and their dial alignments are near perfection. They are often regarded as God tier by watch enthusiasts even though they have models at almost all price points starting out at just 1000 bucks. 

**Timex** is literally the oldest watchmaker in the world. Established in 1854 in the United states. The official suppliers of watches to the US military in World war 1, Timex is not considered usually when luxury brands are discussed but they live true to their founding mission of providing affordable options for the masses. They do have amazing quartz designs in the budget segment with great value for money. 

**Alba** is a sub-brand of another legendary watch maker from Japan called Seiko which was started in 1979 and targets a more budget audience bringing both quartz and mechanical pieces in the 10-15k INR range. (More about Seiko in the next section). 

### Timepieces
1. The Dress Watch - This is usually a watch that is reserved for formal or party occasions and doesn’t have too many complications or detailing on the dials is usually kept minimal to avoid distractions. A dress watch can also be a multi-purpose option which can be dressed down to give a more sporty look by choosing a leather or cloth strap in place of a steel bracelet. My choice is the Casio Edifice EFV-100 series which pays homage to a classic timepiece from another company Omega called the Aqua Terra. Unlike an Omega which causes 4-5 lakh INR you can get your hands on this for 5,000 - 6,000 INR. Its a great daily driver and will work well with formals or casuals alike. Alternatives - Citizen BI510058a or Timex Waterbury lineup.

2. The Chronograph - these are stop watches that can be used as timers with great accuracy apart from looking awesome. There are plenty of options you will find in this category but what I have selected is again from the Edifice line from Casio. This line is inspired from motor racing and has lot of amazing designs but the one I find the best is the EFV-526L. Here also we see a striking resemblance with another Omega watch called the Speedmaster. There are some generic alternatives from the likes of Timex but in the quartz arena there isn’t any other line which can compete with the accuracy of the chronographs from Casio. This model will only set you back a measly 8,000 INR.

3. The Diver - Dive watches have become more popular in recent times. These are used by deep sea divers due to two characteristics. A key characteristic of a dive watch is its rotating bezel with minute markings usually till 15-20 mins which is usually the time a standard oxygen tank lasts. When someone goes for a deep sea dive they align the minute hand of the watch with the start point of the bezel and hence they can easily see how much time they can remain underwater. These watches are also usually water and pressure resistant. My choice here is also a Casio Duro. This watch has been worn by the likes of Bill Gates and Dwane Johnson. The stocks are limited and there is high demand but you can usually get these at the time of writing this article around 8,000 INR. Alternatives include the Timex Q Re-issue lineup. If you are up for a mechanical piece and can spend slightly more you can look into the Alba AL4293X1.

## The 1 Watch Collection

**Strategy** - The strategy here is to quit the game. Get a single watch that is very versatile, can be dressed up for formal occasions and dressed down for casual or sports usage, can work well with multiple bands. This is also as the GADA (Go anywhere Do anything) watch. Since we are going for a single watch I will stick to automatic timepieces. These are very durable and will last for decades and may even be passed down to your family. A thing to be aware of is that as these watches have lot of mechanical parts they require servicing once every 5-7 years to ensure optimum performance.

### Seiko SRPE (Dress KX)
**Seiko** is most well known for being the company that brought the first quartz watch to market. Nowadays they mostly make quality mechanical watches and their movements are also used by many other brands to make premium watches. Hailing from Japan, Seiko was founded in 1881. They design and develop all the components of their watch making them one of the very few vertically integrated brands. Seiko also computer printers and calculators under the name Epson. The model I have chosen is the SRPE line from Seiko. This watch combines elements from many different genres of watches. The sunburst dial and day-date window are very beautifully integrated into the watch like a classic dress watch but the raised indices and hands are reminiscent of a dive watch. It is extremely versatile in its use case and can be worn with almost any outfit. This model goes for around 20,000 - 22,000 INR saving you a good chunk of change over the Apple watch.

### Orient Maestro
**Orient** is also a legendary watchmaker from Japan founded in 1950. They often come with unique vintage looks, are extremely high quality and use inhouse manufactured movements. Orient is owned fully by Epson corporation which means they have deep links with Seiko as well.

The Maestro line is one of the entry level lineup from Orient which aims to bring in new customers from the quartz side of things. It has a very classic look with triangular indices, a simple date window and sharp hands. This makes it a good alternative to the Seiko Dress KX as it doesn’t use any elements from Diver watches and sticks to the classic look. Coming in at only 18,000 - 20,000 INR it also saves you a quite a bit of money over the apple watch and it can be used on different occasions.
