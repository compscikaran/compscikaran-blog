## Writing Software by David Heinemeier Hansson

Talk — In this talk, DHH draws parallels between software development and creative writing. Software Development is often seen from an engineering lens and this talk looks at the “Artsy” aspects of our profession. It brings to light the subjective aspects of writing software. Comparisons are drawn with common practices followed by writers such as emphasizing readability, creating & editing multiple drafts and spending time reading other people‘s books etc.

**Author** — DHH is the creator of Ruby on Rails and the Founder of Basecamp & Hey. He is well known in the Ruby community and was awarded Hacker of the year award for his contributions by Google. Interestingly he has taken part in the 24 hours of Le Mans race in the LMP2 class.

## Architecture the Lost Years by Robert Martin

Talk — Software Architecture nowadays seems to be hijacked by sales and compliance folks who use complicated-looking diagrams which substitute real architecture & design with deployment methodology and proprietary vendor lock-in solutions. This talk aims to bring back the nostalgia of good old fashion object-oriented design. My Favourite quote from this talk — “Architecture should scream the intent of the system”

**Author** — Popularly known as Uncle Bob, Robert Martin is a great titan of our industry. Starting his programming journey at a time when people used Punch cards to write code he has been instrumental in many tectonic shifts in our industry. He organized the meeting in an obscure resort in Utah which led to the Agile Manifesto. He is also credited for coining the term SOLID principles used in object-oriented design.

## Do not walk away from Complexity, Run by Venkat Subramaniam

Talk — Complexity can be a problematic thing when it comes to software development/maintenance hence grasping how a system ends up being unintentionally complicated can help us avoid rework and delays in delivery. Having the ability to easily reason out the system as a whole can be achieved by aspiring for simplicity. In an industry where change is constant, complexity makes it harder for us to adapt to change. A quote to summarize the ethos of this talk — “Less is More”

**Author** — Venkat Subramaniam needs no introduction. He has authored multiple award-winning books and is a staple of the Java Community known for his talks on Functional Programming and Reactive Programming. He has trained and mentored thousands of developers via his company Agile Developer Inc. He is also an instructional professor at the University of Houston. He has been bestowed with many honors such as Java Champion, Microsoft MVP, and Oracle Groundbreaker.

## Demanding Professionalism in Software Development by Robert Martin

Talk — A professional is someone who takes their job seriously. They have pride in their work and their achievements and command respect. Professionals know what they need to do and they don’t compromise on it. A key quality of professionals is to be able to say No.

“Do or do not. There is no try.” — Yoda

Are we professionals? We certainly need to be. Software runs the world be it healthcare, insurance, banking, automobiles, or even household appliances and it’s only time before the lack of standards in our industry causes serious harm to others using our products. Professionals have standards that are checked by regulatory bodies, Doctors have medical license boards, lawyers have the bar council, and architects have the architecture council. Our industry is at a relatively nascent stage considering our profession is only approx 75 years old so I think the question in front of us is whether we want to enforce standards ourselves or we want to wait for politicians and lawmakers to do it for us.

## Qualities of a Highly Effective Architect Keynote by Venkat Subramaniam

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeKheNfO3Yg

Talk — Many developers aspire to become architects. Some of us serve currently as architects while the rest of us may hope to become one some day. We all have worked with architects, some good, and some that could be better. What are the traits of a good architect? What are the skills and qualities we should pick to become a very good one?

“Software is not limited by physics, like buildings are. It is limited by imagination, by design, by organization. In short, it is limited by properties of people, not by properties of the world.” — Ralph Johnson
